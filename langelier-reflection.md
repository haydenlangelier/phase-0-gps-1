Prior to the session i was very confused about just about everything in the git and github worflow
What concepts were clarified during the GPS?
robinson helped to clarify the difference between branches, cloning, add, commiting, useful links, commands, and made things MUCH better
What questions did you ask your pair and the guide?
I didn't have a pair, but i asked my guide everything i didn't know. 
What still confuses you about Git?
it mostly makes sense now, i dont know what i dont know yet 
How was your first experience of pairing in a GPS?
It was great, i want more facetime with someone who knows their stuff well
